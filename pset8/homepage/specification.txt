Usage of JavaScript and Bootstrap:

I used JavaScrip to create interactive components, allowing users to engage with the UI dynamically.
For example, I built a card component where the title is displayed, and the card flips when clicked,
enhancing user interaction.

I used CSS to style common tags that appear across multiple screens, ensuring consistency.
For more specific styling, like elements unique to certain pages, I used Bootstrap's utility
classes to keep the structure flexible and maintainable.
