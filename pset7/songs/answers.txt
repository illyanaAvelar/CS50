1 - Calculating the average of Energy, Valence and Danceability and dividing into groups according to the average.
    If all values ​​are high, the aura is vibrant, if all values ​​are low, the aura is melancholic, and so on, also considering mixtures of values ​​of the averages, for example, if only Energy and Danceability are high, the vibe is more chaotic.

2 - Calculating the average may disregard how much the values ​​vary, for example, if all the values ​​are at extremes.
    To avoid this, it would be possible to characterize the aura of the songs first, and then see which auras stand out.
    It would also be possible to consider the other attributes of the songs for this grouping, such as tempo.
    If the base of songs is from 2018, a more recent data base would also be necessary, to reflect the person's current musical taste.
